I'm a first-year Ph.D. student from the School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne. I'm supervised by Dr.Wafa Johal, Dr.Jorge Goncalves, and Dr.Jarrod Knibbe from the [Human-Computer Interaction Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/hci) and [Human-Robot Interaction Lab](https://chri-lab.github.io/). My research interest focuses on Human-Robot Collaboration.  
I completed my Bachelor's degree in Systems Engineering at the City University of Hong Kong. After that, I worked as a Research Engineer for two years at the [Institute for AI Industry Research](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University.
